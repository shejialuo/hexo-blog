I am fortunate to participate in [GSoC 2024](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/projects/ukm4PTEF) contributing to [Git](https://git-scm.com/). This opportunity not only allows me to engage with one of the most influential open-source projects but also enables me to work under the guidance of experienced developers in the field.

I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to my two mentors, [Patrick](https://github.com/pks-t) and [Karthik](mailto:karthik188@gmail.com), who are both esteemed developers at [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/). Their expertise and guidance are invaluable, and I am incredibly fortunate to have the opportunity to learn from such experienced professionals in the field.

The primary purpose of this page is to serve as an archive for my weekly reports throughout the GSoC journey. These reports will detail my progress, challenges encountered, solutions devised, and learnings acquired each week. The intention behind maintaining this archive is twofold:

1. **Transparency**: To keep a transparent record of my contributions and progress throughout the project. This will allow my mentors, peers, and anyone interested in the project to track its development and my growth as a developer.
2. **Reflection**: To serve as a reflective journal for myself. Documenting my journey will help me analyze my approaches, celebrate milestones, and learn from the challenges I face.
